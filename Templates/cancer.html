     <p>
      One critical factor in choosing health insurance with cancer cover is the easy claim procedure and settlement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The following **Steps need to be followed while requesting an insurance claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Step 1:
      </strong>
      Claim Notification
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       First, a claim or request should be submitted within 7 days of the potential loss or when the loss begins. In any event, this should be completed on time for at most 30 days.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Step 2:
      </strong>
      Submit the Claim Form or Evidence
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        The claim form and the documents required for evidence should be submitted within 30 days of the loss.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Even so, if you can provide a valid reason for not submitting the documents on time, your claim might not be rejected.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Usually, this is acceptable if the circumstances are not under the insured's control, such as a medical emergency.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Step 3:
      </strong>
      Supporting Documents and Examination
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        All documents and medical records related to your treatment should be submitted within 15 days of your discharge from the hospital.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>
        Failing to submit them might be acceptable under exceptional circumstances.
       </p>
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Step 4:
      </strong>
      Claim Settlement
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       <p>
        If all the documents are valid and credible, we will provide you with the claim in a lump sum as soon as possible.
